			<p>Consider the following information about this creature:</p>
			<ul id='main-list'>
				<li>Genomic analysis indicates the shrimp pre-dates planet Earth</li>
				<li>Evidence of telepathic communication from shrimp to other species has been found, occasionally resulting in the recipient's neural manipulation</li>
				<li>Any individual shrimp can access the ShrimpMind, a collective knowledgebase of every shrimp's learned experiences</li>
				<li>Shrimp can enter multiple states, each of which appear to specialize it for certain functions. A few of the more explored configurations are described:
					<ul id='sub-list'>
						<li><span class='states'>Stasis</span>: A state in which the shrimp is able to fiercely self-regenerate in an exterior stillness, resembling hibernation</li>
						<li><span class='states'>Ready State</span>: A state in which the shrimp is primed for immediate action</li>
						<li><span class='states'>Action</span>: A swirling mass of appendages and conviction, often the last sight its prey beholds</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>It's believed they aspire to become the universe itself, in a being known as the AllShrimp </li>
			</ul>
