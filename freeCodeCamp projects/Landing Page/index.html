				<p>Have you ever wished for a better life? Wished you had more time, more success? More adulation?</p>

				<p>Teeny Genie is an opportunity for you to obtain what you seek. More of the Mores you want, and less of the Lesses you don't.</p>

				<p>There's just one catch - there's a chance you may get the bad version of your wish. Think of it as the inverse of what you want. If you wish for breadsticks, if you get the bad version of your wish, you might get fishsticks. Or just some normal sticks.</p>


				<h4>How it Works</h4>

				<p>While Teeny Genie requires you to put up sufficient collateral for a given wish in the event of a bad outcome, the more you use Teeny Genie, the odds shift ever in your favor.</p>

				<p>The randomization starts at 80% bad outcome chance, and 20% good. Every time you use Teeny Genie, your good chance improves 1% (1% of the total 100%, not of your current good percentage. This isn't a trick. Ultimtely, your odds for cap at 80% good outcome chance, and 20% bad outcome chance.</p>

				<h4>I may be small, but you could have it all</h3>
				<p>Have you ever wished your life was better than it is? Wished you had more time, more success? More adulation? How are you at dealing with disappointment?</p>
				<p>Teeny Genie is an opportunity for you to obtain what you seek. More of the Mores you want, and less of the Lesses you don't. The great thing is, standard genie rules apply! That is, you can wish for non-material things, like satisfaction, or time with your family. In fact, you're encouraged to!</p>
				<p>It gets even better; there's no limit on the number of wishes. Because unlike standard genies, Teeny Genie's got stamina. And he's not worried about you making the world worse off if you go nuts getting your wishes fulfilled, or teaching you a lesson. He's not going to judge you one bit.</p>
				<p>There's just one catch - there's a chance you may get the bad version of your wish. Think of it as the inverse of what you want. If you wish for breadsticks, if you get the bad version of your wish, you might get fishsticks. Or just some normal sticks.</p>
