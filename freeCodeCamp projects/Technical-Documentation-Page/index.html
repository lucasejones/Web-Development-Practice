				<h1>The Basics</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>Welcome to the first page of the handbook. If this is your first experience with TypeScript - you may want to start at one of the <a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html#get-started' target='_blank'>'Getting Started'</a> guides.</p>
					<p>Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations. That sounds abstract, but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a variable named <code class='language-none'>message</code>.</p>


					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'
// on 'message' and then calling it
message.toLowerCase();

// Calling 'message'
message();</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a property called <code class='language-none'>toLowerCase</code> and then calls it. The second one tries to call <code class='language-none'>message</code> directly.</p>


					<p>But assuming we don’t know the value of <code class='language-none'>message</code> - and that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll get from trying to run any of this code. The behavior of each operation depends entirely on what value we had in the first place.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Is <code class='language-none'>message</code> callable?
						<li>Does it have a property called <code class='language-none'>toLowerCase</code> on it?
						<li>If it does, is <code class='language-none'>toLowerCase</code> even callable?
						<li>If both of these values are callable, what do they return?</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the details right.
					</p>

					<p>Let’s say <code class='language-none'>message</code> was defined in the following way:<p>

					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>const message = "Hello World!";</code></pre>
					
					<p>As you can probably guess, if we try to run <code class='language-none'>message.toLowerCase()</code>, we’ll get the same string, only in lower-case.</p>

					<p>What about that second line of code? If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:</p>

					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>TypeError: message is not function</code></pre>

					<p>It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.</p>

					<p>When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has. That’s part of what that <code class='language-none'>TypeError</code> is alluding to - it’s saying that the string <code class='language-none'>"Hello World!"</code> cannot be called as a function.</p>

					<p>For some values, such as the primitives <code class='language-none'>string</code> and <code class='language-none'>number</code>, we can identify their type at runtime using the <code class='language-none'>typeof</code> operator. But for other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types. For example, consider this function:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>function fn(x) {
  return x.flip();
}</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work if given an object with a callable <code class='language-none'>flip</code> property, but JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is running. The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what <code class='language-none'>fn</code> does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens. This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what code will do before it runs, which means it’s harder to know what your code is going to do while you’re writing it.</p>

					<p>Seen in this way, a <em>type</em> is the concept of describing which values can be passed to <code class='language-none'>fn</code> and which will crash. JavaScript only truly provides <em>dynamic</em> typing - running the code to see what happens.</p>
					
					<p>The alternative is to use a <em>static</em> type system to make predictions about what code is expected <em>before</em> it runs.</p>

			<section id='Static-Type-checking'>
				<h1>Static Type-checking</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>Think back to that <code class='language-none'>TypeError</code> we got earlier from trying to call a <code class='language-none'>string</code> as a function. <em>Most people</em> don’t like to get any sorts of errors when running their code - those are considered bugs! And when we write new code, we try our best to avoid introducing new bugs.</p>

					<p>If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and immediately see the error, we might be able to isolate the problem quickly; but that’s not always the case. We might not have tested the feature thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into a potential error that would be thrown! Or if we were lucky enough to witness the error, we might have ended up doing large refactorings and adding a lot of different code that we’re forced to dig through.</p>

					<p>Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs <em>before</em> our code runs. That’s what a static type-checker like TypeScript does. <em>Static types systems</em> describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.</p>
					<!-- use <pre class='line-numbers'> to get line numbers. -->
					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre data-line='3'><code class='language-javascript'>const message = "hello!";
 
message();</code>
<p class='highlight code-p'>This expression is not callable.
Type 'String' has no call signatures.</p></pre>
					</div>



<p>Running that last sample with TypeScript will give us an error message before we run the code in the first place.</p>

			<section id='Non-exception-Failures'>
				<h1>Non-exception Failures</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>So far we’ve been discussing certain things like runtime errors - cases where the JavaScript runtime tells us that it thinks something is nonsensical. Those cases come up because <a href='https://tc39.es/ecma262/' target='_blank'>the ECMAScript specification</a> has explicit instructions on how the language should behave when it runs into something unexpected.
					</p>

					<p>For example, the specification says that trying to call something that isn’t callable should throw an error. Maybe that sounds like “obvious behavior”, but you could imagine that accessing a property that doesn’t exist on an object should throw an error too. Instead, JavaScript gives us different behavior and returns the value <code class='language-none'>undefined</code>:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>const user = {
  name: "Daniel",
  age: 26,
};
user.location; // returns undefined</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>Ultimately, a static type system has to make the call over what code should be flagged as an error in its system, even if it’s “valid” JavaScript that won’t immediately throw an error. In TypeScript, the following code produces an error about <code class='language-none'>location</code> not being defined:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre data-line='6'><code class='language-javascript'>const user = {
  name: "Daniel",
  age: 26,
};
 
user.location;</code>
<span class='highlight code-p'>Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.</span></pre>
					</div>
					<p>While sometimes that implies a trade-off in what you can express, the intent is to catch legitimate bugs in our programs. And TypeScript catches <em>a lot</em> of legitimate bugs.</p>

					<p>For example: typos,</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>const announcement = "Hello World!";
 
// How quickly can you spot the typos?
announcement.toLocaleLowercase();
announcement.toLocalLowerCase();
 
// We probably meant to write this...
announcement.toLocaleLowerCase();</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>uncalled functions,</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>function flipCoin() {
  // Meant to be Math.random()
  return Math.random < 0.5;</code>
<span class='highlight code-p'>Operator '<' cannot be applied to types '() => number' and 'number'.</span><code>
}</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>or basic logic errors.</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>const value = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "a" : "b";
if (value !== "a") {
  // ...
} else if (value === "b") {
</code>
<span class='highlight code-p'>This condition will always return 'false' since the types '"a"' and '"b"' have no overlap.</span><code class='language-javascript'>
// Oops, unreachable
}</code></pre>
					</div>
				</div>

			<section id='Types-for-Tooling'>
				<h1>Types for Tooling</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code. That’s great, but TypeScript can <em>also</em> prevent us from making those mistakes in the first place.</p>

					<p>The type-checker has information to check things like whether we’re accessing the right properties on variables and other properties. Once it has that information, it can also start <em>suggesting</em> which properties you might want to use.</p>

					<p>That means TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code too, and the core type-checker can provide error messages and code completion as you type in the editor. That’s part of what people often refer to when they talk about tooling in TypeScript.</p>

					<p>TypeScript takes tooling seriously, and that goes beyond completions and errors as you type. An editor that supports TypeScript can deliver “quick fixes” to automatically fix errors, refactorings to easily re-organize code, and useful navigation features for jumping to definitions of a variable, or finding all references to a given variable. All of this is built on top of the type-checker and is fully cross-platform, so it’s likely that <a href='https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support' target='_blank'>your favorite editor has TypeScript support available</a>.</p>

			<section id='tsc-the-TypeScript-Compiler'>
				<h1><code class='language-none'>tsc</code>, the TypeScript Compiler</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>We’ve been talking about type-checking, but we haven’t yet used our type-<em>checker</em>. Let’s get acquainted with our new friend <code class='language-none'>tsc</code>, the TypeScript compiler. First we’ll need to grab it via npm.</p>

					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>npm install -g typescript</code></pre>

					<p>This installs the TypeScript Compiler <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> globally. You can use <code class='language-none'>npx</code> or similar tools if you’d prefer to run tsc from a local <code class='language-none'>node_modules</code> package instead.</p>

					<p>Now let’s move to an empty folder and try writing our first TypeScript program: <code class='language-none'>hello.ts</code>:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>// Greets the world.
console.log("Hello world!");</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>Notice there are no frills here; this “hello world” program looks identical to what you’d write for a “hello world” program in JavaScript. And now let’s type-check it by running the command <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> which was installed for us by the <code class='language-none'>typescript</code> package.</p>
					
					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>tsc hello.ts</code></pre>

					<p>Tada!</p>

					<p>Wait, “tada” what exactly? We ran <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> and nothing happened! Well, there were no type errors, so we didn’t get any output in our console since there was nothing to report.</p>

					<p>But check again - we got some <em>file</em> output instead. If we look in our current directory, we’ll see a <code class='language-none'>hello.js</code> file next to <code class='language-none'>hello.ts</code>. That’s the output from our <code class='language-none'>hello.ts</code> file after <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> <em>compiles</em> or <em>transforms</em> it into a plain JavaScript file. And if we check the contents, we’ll see what TypeScript spits out after it processes a <code class='language-none'>.ts</code> file:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>// Greets the world.
console.log("Hello world!");</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>In this case, there was very little for TypeScript to transform, so it looks identical to what we wrote. The compiler tries to emit clean readable code that looks like something a person would write. While that’s not always so easy, TypeScript indents consistently, is mindful of when our code spans across different lines of code, and tries to keep comments around.</p>

					<p>What about if we <em>did</em> introduce a type-checking error? Let’s rewrite <code class='language-none'>hello.ts</code>:</p>

					<div class='prism-div'>
						<pre><code class='language-javascript'>// This is an industrial-grade general-purpose greeter function:
function greet(person, date) {
  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date}!`);
}
 
greet("Brendan");</code></pre>
					</div>

					<p>If we run <code class='language-none'>tsc hello.ts</code> again, notice that we get an error on the command line!</p>

					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.</code></pre>
					
					<p>TypeScript is telling us we forgot to pass an argument to the <code class='language-none'>greet</code> function, and rightfully so. So far we’ve only written standard JavaScript, and yet type-checking was still able to find problems with our code. Thanks, TypeScript!</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id='Emitting-with-Errors'>
				<h1>Emitting with Errors</h1>
				<div class='sub-content'>
					<p>One thing you might not have noticed from the last example was that our <code class='language-none'>hello.js</code> file changed again. If we open that file up then we’ll see that the contents still basically look the same as our input file. That might be a bit surprising given the fact that <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> reported an error about our code, but this is based on one of TypeScript’s core values: much of the time, <em>you</em> will know better than TypeScript.</p>

					<p>To reiterate from earlier, type-checking code limits the sorts of programs you can run, and so there’s a tradeoff on what sorts of things a type-checker finds acceptable. Most of the time that’s okay, but there are scenarios where those checks get in the way. For example, imagine yourself migrating JavaScript code over to TypeScript and introducing type-checking errors. Eventually you’ll get around to cleaning things up for the type-checker, but that original JavaScript code was already working! Why should converting it over to TypeScript stop you from running it?</p>

					<p>So TypeScript doesn’t get in your way. Of course, over time, you may want to be a bit more defensive against mistakes, and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly. In that case, you can use the <a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noEmitOnError' target='blank'>noEmitOnError</a> compiler option. Try changing your <code class='language-none'>hello.ts</code> file and running <code class='language-none'>tsc</code> with that flag:</p>

					<pre class='tall'><code class='language-javascript'>tsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts</code></pre>
					
					<p>You’ll notice that <code class='language-none'>hello.js</code> never gets updated.</p>
