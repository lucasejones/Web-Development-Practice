<!-- "Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations. That sounds abstract, but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a variable named message.

// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'
// on 'message' and then calling it
message.toLowerCase();
// Calling 'message'
message();
If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a property called toLowerCase and then calls it. The second one tries to call message directly.

But assuming we don’t know the value of message - and that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll get from trying to run any of this code. The behavior of each operation depends entirely on what value we had in the first place.

Is message callable?
Does it have a property called toLowerCase on it?
If it does, is toLowerCase even callable?
If both of these values are callable, what do they return?
The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the details right.

Let’s say message was defined in the following way.

const message = "Hello World!";
As you can probably guess, if we try to run message.toLowerCase(), we’ll get the same string only in lower-case.

What about that second line of code? If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:

TypeError: message is not a function
It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.

When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has. That’s part of what that TypeError is alluding to - it’s saying that the string "Hello World!" cannot be called as a function.

For some values, such as the primitives string and number, we can identify their type at runtime using the typeof operator. But for other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types. For example, consider this function:

function fn(x) {
  return x.flip();
}
We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work if given an object with a callable flip property, but JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is running. The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what fn does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens. This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what code will do before it runs, which means it’s harder to know what your code is going to do while you’re writing it.

Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values can be passed to fn and which will crash. JavaScript only truly provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what happens.

The alternative is to use a static type system to make predictions about what code is expected before it runs.
